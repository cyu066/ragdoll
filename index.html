    <h3 class="heading">About Ragdoll Cat</h3>
    <pre class="text">
        The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. 
        Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. 
        American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 1960s. 
        They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature. 
        The name 'Ragdoll' is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original 
        breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up. 
        The breed is particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

        Ragdolls are often known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats", 
        due to their tendency to follow people around, their receptiveness to handling, 
        and their relative lack of aggression towards other pets.

        Ragdolls are distinguishable by their pointed coloration 
        (where the body is lighter than the face, ears, legs, and tail),
        large round blue eyes, soft, thick coats, thick limbs, 
        long tails, and soft bodies. 
        Their color rings are commonly tricolor or bicolor.
